This app notifies you if a reply is made to AutoModerator, the subreddit -ModTeam user, or any other users you configure to be monitored.

Mods don't have easy visiblity when a user replies to a bot, Dev Platform app account, Automod or the -ModTeam user. Often, there may be something that needs to be actioned.

## Notification Options

There are a number of different ways you can choose to be notified. You can choose one or more methods to alert the mod team with.

Note: Notifications will only be sent if the user replies within 28 days of the comment being replied to, and notifications will not be sent for comments that were filtered to the modqueue or immediately removed by Automoderator or Reddit's filters.

Notifications will only be sent for replies to comments that were made after the app was installed and configured to look for that user.

### Report
